In India, an accident occurs every two minutes, primarily due to riders not wearing helmets and the lack of timely medical assistance. To address this issue, we developed a Smart Helmet that enhances rider safety by ensuring helmet compliance and integrating advanced safety features.

A helmet serves as essential protection for riders in case of an accident. Our Smart Helmet takes this a step further by incorporating features such as alcohol detection, location tracking, accident detection, fall detection, and hands-free communication.

The helmet is designed to enforce safety measures—the bike will not start unless the rider is wearing the helmet, as it sends a signal to the bike via an NRF module. Additionally, if the system detects that the rider is intoxicated during the journey, the helmet will send a warning message to the rider and automatically turn off the bike’s ignition.

In the event of an accident or emergency, the helmet can track the rider’s location and send an alert with their coordinates, ensuring timely assistance. This innovation aims to significantly reduce accidents and enhance rider safety using cutting-edge technology.
